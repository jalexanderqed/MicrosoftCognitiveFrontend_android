# Microsoft Cognitive Frontend
## Demo App for Facial Recognition and Tagging with the Microsoft Cognitive APIs

This is an Android Studio project containing an app that will take a 
picture and upload it to a remote server for tagging with age, gender, 
facial hair, glasses, and emotional expression.
It is designed for use with the 
[Microsoft Cognitive Services API](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services), 
but the backend server is responsible for calling this service and 
could theoretically use any service.

NOTE that this is only a demo app and has certain elements
(particularly HTTP requests) that should certainly be reimplemented.
